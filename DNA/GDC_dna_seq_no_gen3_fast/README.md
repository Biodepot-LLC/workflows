# GDC DNA-Seq Pipeline (No GEN3, Fast)

![](images/image1.png)

# Implemented with the BioDepot-workflow-builder (Bwb)

# Overview

This version of the [GDC DNA-Seq no GEN3 workflow](https://github.com/Biodepot-LLC/workflows/tree/master/DNA/GDC_dna_seq_no_gen3) is faster, as it does not wait for Mutect2 and Pindel before launching igv.

The original GDC DNA-Seq workflow is located [here](https://github.com/Biodepot-LLC/workflows/tree/master/DNA/GDC_dna_seq).
